   This README.md is part of the documentation for the R script, analysis.R. Analysis.R reads in two sets of accelerometer data generated by devices worn by 30 subjects. Seventy percent of the subjects were in the training group and thirty percent in the test group. The data sets for each group are prefixed with “test” or “train”.

   The script reads in: 

    1) column names for the data sets

    2) Subject identification numbers

    3) descriptive names for each activity type. 

   The script adds the descriptive names to the columns and converts the activity types to descriptive names. The script combines the “test” and “train” data sets and then:

    1) generates of subset of the data by pulling out all the columns that represent a mean or standard deviation of an     observation. 

    2) The script then groups the data by Activity type within Subject and summarizes the mean for each subject/activity group.

    3) This mean by group data is output as a tidy data set to a text file named tidy_data.txt. 

More information can be found in the script comments and in the file CodeBook.md.
